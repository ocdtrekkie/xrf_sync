# XRF Sync

XRF Sync is a very light web service intended to allow instances of applications on different computers across the Internet to send each other commands.

Note that the primary focus is now [XRF Sync for Sandstorm](https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/xrf_sync_sandstorm), and while I may port some compatible adjustments back to this version, it is deprecated at this point.
